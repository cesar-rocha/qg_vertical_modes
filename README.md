# QG vertical modes
<p>The following JuPyter notebooks contain details about the calculation and provide the codes used in Rocha, Young, and Grooms (in prep.). An index  notebook is available <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/crocha700/qg_vertical_modes/blob/master/index.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

<p>Even if you do not have python install on your computer, you can still reproduce our results. The simplest way is to open a free <a href="https://wakari.io" target="_new">Wakari</a> account, and run our notebooks in the cloud.</p>

<p>If you have trouble installing numba, just comment out the lines with @numba.jjit. This is a simple decorator to speed up the code.</p>

<p>If you have any questions please contact Cesar B. Rocha <crocha@ucsd.edu>. You are also encouraged to contact Rocha if you find a mistake (or even better you could submit a pull request)</p>
